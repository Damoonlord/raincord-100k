This one is plain text. It's a message from an Iterator from conversation group.

"1582.170 - unknown group(NULL)

CH: Hey, what should I do? These cycles have been getting so much fun lately. 

CH: I'm so glad I get to know you all.

CH: These communication arrays will decay and we will rot away and hopefully one day die.

CH: Yet, that makes me feel kind of sad.

...

CH: You know perhaps, there's no point in finding the solution.

CH: Perhaps, we all should cherish the present a little more."

Maybe this is slightly unrelated, but,

Now that I think about it, I do appreciate your company very much. 

I imagine these cycles will get lonely without you.

So, thank you for staying here, even for just a moment.
