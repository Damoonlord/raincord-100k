These are the global schematics for a particular Iterator structure.

Whether it was ever built or not I sadly do not know, but judging from the designs it seems it would have been quite the ordeal if it was!

It seems this one was designed to be built high above the surface of this world by repeatedly launching materials <LINE>and organisms into space. I am curious to learn how this idea was ever considered feasible.

Especially the logistics of keeping such a structure elevated like that! While it agrees with some theoretical models of <LINE>gravitational acceleration around spherical bodies, I don't recall such models applying to reality in this way.

Then again, I don't recall a lot of things...

But even despite that issue, this Iterator structure seems to rely heavily on the possibility of resupplies by cargo rocket. <LINE>With the state of my equipment and what I can see near Pebbles, I highly doubt such methods would still be functional, <LINE>let alone fit to carry such significant masses up so far...

Not to mention the fact that a lack of propellant would mean certain destruction...

...

Don't worry, <PLAYERNAME>. I doubt that such a structure would ever have been built.
