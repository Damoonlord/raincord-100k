This pearl details a long-lost celebration of birth. Do you know what the term "birthday" means, <PLAYERNAME>?

Long ago, it referred to when a benefactor was born.

It referred to one's entry into the cycle and was a grand event- all of the individual's kin gathered around to <LINE>shower them with praise and all manner of gifts.

Everyone would sing joyous songs and feast on fine pastries and desserts before opening wrapped gifts. <LINE>Younger ones would get toys and sparkly items while older ones might have gotten items suited to their hobbies and clothes.

Iterators do not have birthdays. We were not born like our benefactors were, so we do not typically celebrate any kind of birthday- <LINE>though some of us do celebrate the day of our activation with our friends as some symbolic expression.

I have heard stories of my fellow iterators sharing cheerful stories of the past on such days. <LINE>Sometimes they exchange data pearls or upload memory pictures to the "birthday party group".

Personally, I do not remember celebrating my activation in the past. I certainly cannot now- not with the state I am in. <LINE>I do not even remember when that date was. it has been so long...

Who knows? Maybe today is my birthday? Maybe it is tomorrow? Next week?

Thank you for sharing this pearl with me, <PLAYERNAME>. Sometimes, when the world looks bleak, <LINE>it helps to recall a time when it was not so.
