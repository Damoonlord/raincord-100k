Oh, do you want me to read this?

I'm sorry, it's blank. There's nothing here.

The way the bumps and valleys of the pearl's surface are arranged makes me thing there was supposed to be something written, but it looks like it was fabricated incorrectly. I could speculate on what time period this was created in, but it's such an unremarkable misprint that I really can't do anything with this.

Here you go, <PLAYERNAME>. Maybe you can find a better use for it.
