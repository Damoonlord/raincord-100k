This one seems to have been written by one of my creators. 

It contains a simple message. I'll read it to you.

"I want to be a slugcat cleaning pipes"

I do not quite know what it means, it seems the idea is beyond my comprehension.

I guess some wished to be something they are not.

<CAPPLAYERNAME>, do you ever wish to be something you are not?
