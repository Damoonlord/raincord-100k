Oh, you want me to read this to you?

How interesting!<LINE>This is a record from the construction of an iterator I've never personally met: Six Loaves.

It's a payment confirmation for the transportation of astounding quantities of steel to the construction site.

It seems the transportation was scheduled to be done via purposed organism.<LINE>It makes one wonder why one would need to pay at all.

Perhaps it's because the genome was kept private for competitive advantage.

This is a telling insight, although I believe scientific advancement shouldn't be treated as property.
