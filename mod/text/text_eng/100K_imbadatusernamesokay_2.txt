It's a genome for a purposed organism. Do you know what a purposed organism is?

Like most late organisms, this one has a very small brain, allowing for easily made chips to be inserted into the stem.

This made complex brains cost effective and easy, and eventually some purposed organisms were directly controlled by their parent iterator. 

Though this one is rather unorthodox, using only a thick membrane for much of its skin. <LINE>With enough internal pressure, even the most graceful grasp would spray internal fluids everywhere.
