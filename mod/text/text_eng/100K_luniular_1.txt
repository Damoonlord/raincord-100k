This one is just plain text. It seems to be a goodbye from one of my creators. I will read it for you.

"The past, the present, the future, intertwining to create a present.<LINE>A timeline, a circle, a loop, a cycle.<LINE>The passage of time will continue to flow no matter its form.

Yet even now, I feel as if I am floating away, drifting.<LINE>Looking down as the emptiness stares back at me, I ask myself.<LINE>On the day where all the stars fade from the skies, I wonder...<LINE>Will I still be drifting away?

However, now that it is time for me to go,<LINE>A feeling of uncertainty of envelops my heart.

But perhaps one day, the void will too swallow the skies.<LINE>...<LINE>In the end, all I wanted is to be fulfilled, so please fill me."
