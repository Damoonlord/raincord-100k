This pearl seems to be a poem.

It speaks of how happiness is achieved once one lets go, and how the world wants to keep its grip. It sounds like the works of a philosopher.<LINE>I'll read it to you.

One wishes to escape,<LINE>One wishes to enter,

Both want something that sparks joy to them,<LINE>But they can't have it,

And they haven't realised that they need content with what they have to be complete.

But the one in Limbo has, and it's too late for him,<LINE>So he prays for the Two,

And if his prayers are heard, and they are told to let go,

The masses will plead for their company, desperate to keep their hold, but it is too late,<LINE>For they are happy.
