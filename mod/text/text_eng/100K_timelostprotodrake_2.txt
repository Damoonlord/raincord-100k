This one is quite hard to read... I think it might've been discarded a very long time ago.

Oh! It seems to be a conversation between two iterators, very far from here. Where did you get this? 

I'll read it out to you:

"<PRIVATE BROADCAST> Accretion Disc Sighting, Variability Within Magnitude 

ADS: I've been thinking. 

VWM: We do that a lot. 

ADS: No- I don't think a thought is proper to describe it. 

VWM: What would you call it then? 

ADS: Don't laugh. 

VWM: I don't got all day. 

ADS: Dreaming, I think it was a dream. 

VWM: Go on. 

ADS: You're hearing me out on this? That's new. 

VWM: Don't have anything better to do. 

ADS: Someplace far out, it's disjointed, a collection of love? No, that's too weak a word- passion! Made by a hundred thousand strands. 

VWM: Sounds stupid. 

ADS: I'm putting this in words you can understand. 

VWM: Show me then, this 'place made by a hundred thousand strands.'

ADS: I'll try." 

From here on out the broadcast cannot be translated into text, but the visualizations it makes, vague as they can be...<LINE>I suppose I understand why they call it a collection of passion. 

Thank you for showing me this, <PLAYERNAME>.
