What an odd find, <PLAYERNAME>.

This pearl is filled with paragraphs upon paragraphs of text, yet I cannot extract any specific meaning from them.

Perhaps it's an artistic project? I believe I still remember something about them, though it's not very concrete.

There was always a surprising amount of them who found value in the creation of effortless irrelevance.<LINE>That's not to say that they did not try their hardest to accomplish this effortlessness, paradoxically enough.

In fact, while for most it was a battle on its own to retain any sense of purpose in the face of the predicament<LINE>we now know so well ourselves, they decided they 'cared too much,' thus pouring countless cycles into the undoing of this purpose.

As much as I fail to understand their ideology, I find it admirable how hard they worked to abide by it,<LINE>even if doing so was something of a self-defeating act.

Either way, there's every chance that there isn't such meaning behind this, since I doubt even they would come up with<LINE>'constant cloud triplanar hello sixteen.' Perhaps mushrooms were involved?
