Hmm... Ah hah! Wonderful find <PLAYERNAME>! This is the blueprint for an old oil drill site. <LINE>There was so many drills they had to put a fully void fluid-powered core in the middle.

It was placed somewhere under the chimney canopies nearby... You could probably find it's old unfinished frame through the western caves.

Good luck <PLAYERNAME>!
