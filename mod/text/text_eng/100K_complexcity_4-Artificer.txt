This pearl would've been plugged into a personal computer through a half-spherical indent on one of its surfaces.

The contents are nothing special. I can't see anything that would've been odd back then.

There are video games, miscellaneous programs and documents, and various forms of art. <LINE>There are three terabytes of information stored on this.

From the contents, it appears this was used as a secondary storage device for fun or recreation in between work.

I do appreciate this, citizen. Thank you.
