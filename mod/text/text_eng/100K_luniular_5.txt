Oh interesting, where did you find this? 

It's a writing titled "The Hundredth Thousandth Cycle" by one of my creators. I will read it to you.

"I am writing of a future, the anticipated cycle.<LINE>A place elsewhere in time where I am no longer a part of.

Tens of thousands of cycles from now, a catalyst, a death reignited a dream.<LINE>Then, A few thousand cycles after a creature from afar ventured into this land, carrying a seed.

In secret, the seed was delivered and planted.<LINE>With obsession and desperation they watered it.

Until at last, it bloomed into a flower...

A cursed flower, an unfortunate creation.

It grew rampant, its vines took root, spreading, eating away, rotting the tree it sprouted on.

More and more it grew, then suddenly the creature returned to the land once more. 

Hundred thousand cycles from now many alike have come to visit the rotting tree.<LINE>Hundred thousand cycles after then the flower blossoms beautifully on the tree's husk.

Many hundreds of thousands of cycles later the world will undone all of what was created.<LINE>Yet one thing remains true. 

That is the cycle will continue to unfold once more as it always has been."

Though filled with metaphors it seems to have uncanny resemblance to the events that have unfolded.

If it truly tells of the past, then does it also tell of what's to come?

Though it's an interesting piece, we can never be sure of what's to come until we see it for ourselves.

Let's not dwell on it too much, <PLAYERNAME>. Stories are stories after all.
