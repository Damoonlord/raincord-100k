This one is just plain text. I will read it to you.

"It is with Honor that I, Bright Malus-Golden Cynictis, of the House of Rain World,<LINE>Humble messenger of the Congregation of Peanuts, write this to You.

We need you to acknowledge how we feel about this situation.<LINE>Indeed, until now we can safely affirm that we have not forfeit our endeavors about you, that we will not cast you aside.

This not only confirms that we will not be away or leaving your side, but also that no tears should be the fault of our behaviour,<LINE>and that we do not plan to bid our farewell.

Truly, this comes with all of our deepest honesty, any harm would be absolutely unthinkable."

.... I wonder if this is some kind of joke.
