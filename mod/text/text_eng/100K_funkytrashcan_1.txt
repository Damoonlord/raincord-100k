Oh, this pearl is about me, when I was still young. I remember the circumstances under which this was written,<LINE>but I do not recall if I ever saw this specific correspondence. 

Skipping the relatively short introductions, the main body of the memo reads as follows; 

"After careful consideration by the Grand Council of Leaves and the Grand Engineering Guild of the South,<LINE>the proposed modifications to the puppet of the iterator Looks to the Moon have been approved.

We humbly recognize that her initial construcion by our forefathers, while not flawed,<LINE>did not conform to how our esteemed iterator's identity would develop.

As we have refined the iterator project since then, we hope that incidents like this shall be avoided in the future.<LINE>However, when the need arises, we hope that the work we will do here will serve as a template for other engineers to resolve issues regarding our benevolent iterators' identities. 

The major approved alterations to the puppet are as follows: 

Redistribution of mass from shoulders to hips. <LINE>Lightening of vocal box. <LINE>Alteration of symbol from a golden crescent to a pink-red sphere. 

Other minor adjustments will also be made for the sake of updating the puppet's systems <LINE>to be more in line with the current generation of iterators."

<CAPPLAYERNAME>, have you ever heard about trans people?
