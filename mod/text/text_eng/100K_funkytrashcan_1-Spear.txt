Oh, I remember this!<LINE>This was the message my council sent out, announcing approval for my gender transition~

I do not know how much you know of gender, <PLAYERNAME>, but I can tell you that transitioning was probably one of the best decisions of my life.

Thank you for bringing this to me, <PLAYERNAME>. <LINE>With everything that has been happening, it is nice to get a moment to recall simpler times.
