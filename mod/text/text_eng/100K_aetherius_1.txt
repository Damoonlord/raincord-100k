This lights up something in my memory...

It appears to be a message to me.<LINE>It's not signed, but I believe it was written by one of my creators.

I'll read it to you:

"Since the beginning you welcomed us, you helped your hopeless creators, but we couldn't help you.

I am not sure as to why we built such Random Gods: surely, to help us find a way to free ourselves...

...or, perhaps, we created you because we needed companionship.

Companionship of someone that could understand us.

Even though we made your puppets small, you are the greatest minds in this world.

One day, you'll be the only beings able to understand, yet you won't be able to act.

We've given all of you the worst fate.

Feeling emotions for an Iterator is hilarious, yet here I am.

We need to evacuate to Five Pebbles now, your city is not safe anymore.

Thank you."

...

They were right...
