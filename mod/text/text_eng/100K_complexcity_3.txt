Oh! This one is very interesting.

It's a copy of exactly fifteen hours three minutes and fifty seven seconds of videos from the cycles leading up to the Global Ascension. <LINE>They are of varying length and quality, though they all push the time's hardware to their limits.

There are two versions, one with every video spliced together alongside copies of all of them individually.

The ones that aren't professionally recorded are authored by the same person. They never say their name, nor does anyone else.

The contents of the videos are cobbled together videos of things like detailed tours of various buildings, readings of papers on various subjects, <LINE>personal or familial memories, and advertisements for popular products. They range from hours long to mere moments.

The pearl itself seems to have been placed under coarse solid objects based on the superficial defects. <LINE>None of these affect the quality of the videos.

The very last recording seems to happen as this area's Global Ascension was happening.

It's the highest quality recording here. It's so close that you can make out what I can only assume is my superstructure in the distance, <LINE>though my memory of that day has faded.

The tone of the person speaking is somber but hopeful. It goes all the way up to when it's the turn of the one recording to ascend. <LINE>They neatly place their recording device on the floor, but it gets knocked over moments later.

This individual can be heard pleading for these recordings to be saved before reciting a final phrase common at the time. <LINE>Twelve people stated these exact words.

Seeing as this pearl is here with us today, it seems their wish came true.

It is utterly fascinating to see the love and care to this world that they wanted to document it to whatever came after them.

After pondering for so long, I finally think I would forgive them if I ever could.

Thank you for this, <PLAYERNAME>.
