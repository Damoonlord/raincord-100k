I believe something may be wrong with this pearl, though I do not see any damage that might explain why.

If I am interpreting it correctly, though, it's a poem - but it keeps changing, every time I read it.

Interestingly, it hasn't changed into any organisation that doesn't at the very least 'work' in artistic terms, <LINE>so perhaps it is intentional after all?

I am not certain if reading it to you would properly translate its intent, given how intertwined the medium seems to be with its meaning, <LINE>but perhaps I can give you the gist.

It speaks of an ancient forest, permanently covered in shadow. Perhaps it is a metaphor?<LINE>If I had my memories, maybe I would have had sufficient cultural context to understand.

But this shade doesn't necessarily seem to be considered something negative. Rather, it wishes to draw comfort from it?

The author's intent probably went much further than that, so it's a little frustrating that this is as much as I can glean from it.

Though perhaps your unique perspective grants you a deeper understanding than I could ever achieve, <PLAYERNAME>!
