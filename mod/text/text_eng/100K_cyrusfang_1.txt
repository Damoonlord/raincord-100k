Ah.

This is a children's story, one I already know well. It is about two good friends, one a stone and the other a leaf.

A flood comes and separates them. The leaf is washed away but the stone remains unmoved, <LINE>and so each of them was pulled apart by their differing natures.

At first, both blame the other, feeling it was they who were abandoned. But as time passes, each realizes that <LINE>it is as much the fault of their own nature as it is the fault of their friend's that they were torn apart.

The story ends on a happy note when a fortunate breeze reunites the leaf with the stone, both apologizing to the other, <LINE>but neither able to change their ways, should a flood come again.

The moral, one supposes, is to accept people as they are, to not begrudge them when they are not how you expect them to be, <LINE>and to not cling too tightly to those who you are close to. 

Passivity in the face of adversity and change was considered a great virtue, <LINE>as was the willingness to forsake attachments when they grew difficult to maintain.

...

I don't like this story very much.

...<LINE>But thank you for bringing it to me all the same, <PLAYERNAME>.
