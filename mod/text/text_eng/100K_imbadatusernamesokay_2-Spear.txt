It's the genome for a purposed organism. <LINE>Strangely, it has no signature and I can't remember anything like it.

Beyond a few... interesting design decisions, it's fairly rudimentary and very similar to a muluscoid base line.

I surely can't think of an industrial application for this. Maybe it was an unfinished experimental piece.
