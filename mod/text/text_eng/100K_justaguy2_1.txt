A memo for the future. Future me, of course, who else would read it? <LINE>Why did I ask myself that question? <LINE>Better yet--why do I waste my time at all.

"Since the Triple Affirmative and the confirmation that the Great Problem had a Great Solution. <LINE>The hearts and minds of Iterators everywhere have been overtaken with manufactured feelings of division.

I've intercepted thousands of transmissions, and I've concluded that these haughty attempts at belief <LINE>are somehow just as narrow-minded as the search for an impractical solution itself.

The Benefactors may have abandoned us, they may have left us to a fate not even they would face. <LINE>But there's one quality they made sure to install into each and every one of our mainframes...

Cowardice. The Benefactors, they made us all cowards!

The only way a breakthrough could ever be achieved is not by scrambling through a labyrinth for hundreds of years hoping to find an exit! <LINE>And it most assuredly isn't running simulations or prevaricating the most desired outcome of all.

A breakthrough comes from risk! It comes from being bold! And it comes from passion! 

The benefactors in their close-mindedness labeled the solution as the very vex they were attempting to solve. <LINE>To become truly effortless is to have the gall to make an effort towards it!

Yet every single one of us purposed beings, we're all designed to be cowards!

Not me. I was given a plan, and a course of action. And the trivial subject of a "chance of success" matters <LINE>as little as Sliver of Straw's desperate attempt at the true triple affirmative!

Perhaps the benefactors did truly doom us by design... <LINE>but they built myself in the process, undoing all the work of their vain and misguided counterparts...

I will make the effort, and I will take the risk."

And I've accepted that I must suffer the worst of that result.
