This pearl has the contents of a broadcast of a local iterator group. Not any local group near me, however.

It sounds like this group's iterators kept disappearing or becoming unresponsive one by one... Let me read it to you.

"1306.277 - PRIVATE
Cracked Clay Statues, Ebullient Pirouette, Pristine Discoveries

CCS: Have you two heard anything from Scattered Scars or Ruptured Lands recently? Anything at all?

EP: Cracked Clay Statues, you know Ruptured Lands hasn't and won't respond to anything. She's active, <LINE>but she hasn't answered to a single one of our messages since somewhere around 1143.

CCS: Okay... But what about Scattered Scars? They've been unresponsive for a few days now.

PD: Oh, I heard from them about... 10 cycles ago, give or take?

EP: When was the last time you talked to them, Cracked Clay Statues? I know you talk to them often.

CCS: 11 cycles ago... Pristine Discoveries, what were they talking about?

PD: You. They didn't say anything that would've been related to their silence, though.

CCS: Oh? Was I really the last thing they were talking about before they stopped responding??? <LINE>Ebullient Pirouette. When did they last talk to you.

EP: 63 cycles ago. We don't talk much, one on one. Maybe within group broadcasts like this, <LINE>if you can call this one... We're missing two.

CCS: Ugh. I just wish they mentioned anything that could've caused their sudden silence... If there is any reason.

EP: We'll figure it out. I'll send a broadcast their way. If they don't respond, I'll force one."

It was always sad to see more and iterators become unresponsive.

It didn't happen commonly, back then, when I wasn't... here. However, the impact was all the same.

I'm sure even more local groups have started to go through the same thing this one did. <LINE>Either iterators collapse or just refuse to communicate, one by one...

I wonder how my own is doing. Hopefully they're well.

Ah, no matter. Thank you, <PLAYERNAME>.
