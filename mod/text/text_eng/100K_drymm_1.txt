It's quite scratched - but that's okay! Iterators tend to write the most important information within the center, <LINE>so there may be some interesting tidbits in here. Now, let's see.

Ohh...

... This-

... Okay. I- I think I have recovered well enough. Thank you for being patient.

This is a qualia pearl, though far from a happy one. 

Whoever wrote this pearl did so over existing data - I believe there used to be a census underneath - and gouged it with long, <LINE>looping scrambles that resemble animal scratches more than writing. 

For better or for worse, its meaning is still decipherable. There is no distinct image to be gleaned, <LINE>yet the crashing pain, the desperate wishes, the bitter loathing of one's own self... <LINE>I felt like I had swam in that void forever.

As much as I dislike dwelling on it, it reminds me of my collapse. Hollow. Hopeless. Insignificant.

Such grief... I dearly hope this iterator is happier now, or at least had made peace with their sorrow.
