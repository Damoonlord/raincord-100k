This seems to be a private recording of an iterator. I hope they don't mind me reading this.

"I write this pearl in honor of my creators.

Though many of our kind scorn them for their past actions, I had been shown that not all of them were as uncaring. <LINE>For this I am forever thankful. 

I miss you, Windswept Weeds, Solemn Clouds, Sixteen Droplets, Twelve Threads, and all the others who had <LINE>a role in bringing me and these gardens to life.

I will honor you by performing the tasks you have given me until I am rendered inoperative."

What a heartfelt message. I wonder how that iterator is doing.

Are they still performing their tasks, even now? I hope they haven't fallen into disrepair yet.
