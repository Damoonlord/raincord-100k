This one is a rather unique find, <PLAYERNAME>. When the ancients tunneled their way to the void,<LINE>they passed layers of civilizations from long before, supposedly seeking the same answers. 

This pearl is a stratigraphy report, detailing some archaeological findings from within the tunnel.<Line>Tablets of poetry, records... iconography. 

...

I hesitate to speculate about what these far-gone authors might've been like. What will they think of me,<LINE>when the next intelligent species comes along and finds me an unrecognizable pile of scrap? What stories will they engineer for me?

A fascinating thought experiment, I think I will ponder it for a while.
