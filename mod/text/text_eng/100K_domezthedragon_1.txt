Oh, this appears to be a conversation from another iterator group, let me read it for you.

"1605.376 - LOCAL GROUP [FIVEISLANDSAMONGWHISPERINGWAVES]<LINE>FiveIslandsAmongWhisperingWaves group, all participants public

TFL: Hey, guys, something just happened that scared me a lot, and could have easily led to me losing contact with you four.

FC: Oh no! What was it? Please tell me your safe!

TCS: Leaves! You got me worried now!

TFL: Well, as you know, the dense flora around my structure has already been growing a lot in the absence of our creators.

TFL: And because of them spreading to the top of my structure, they caused the integrity of one of the buildings to falter, which, in turn, caused it to collapse and break open my chamber.

FC: Oh dear! I hope you weren't hurt!

TCS: Yeah, we don't need you to suddenly vanish out of the blue!

TFL: Fortunately, I wasn't in the spot where the chamber got broken when it happened, or else my umbilical would have gotten severed most likely!

ES: I came to see what all the commotion was on the group, was not expecting this, well, glad you're okay Leaves.

ES: .. Hold on, let me get UA's attention on this, as he's likely distracted, like usual.

<NOTIFICATION | ES - UA>

UA: Ugh, you wanted me-?

UA: Oh, I see, well, guess it's good that you didn't get hurt Leaves, now, Skies, can I go back to my work now?

ES: Yeah, sorry.."

Well, that was certainly, something..

I hope he's still doing okay.
