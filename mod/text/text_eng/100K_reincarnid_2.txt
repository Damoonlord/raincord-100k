I'm amazed. this one is a neuro-spiritual stimulant. It records the experience of a moment where a monk <LINE>lightly dips a finger into a stream of water, and then... his mind is flooded...

...with an astonishing...

...sense... of...

...enlightenment.

My apologies. The feeling is incredibly intense, even to me.

If I still had the equipment to allow you to read this pearl, you would share that same enlightenment. <LINE>Events like these were impossibly rare, and the monk likely lost their life formatting the experience to a pearl.

Still, the study of these pearls always led to breakthroughs in the karmic sciences, <LINE>while public exposure to the enlightenment gave rise to...

...

Oh. The enlightening feeling has already worn off. This pearl's probably just the work of a con artist.
