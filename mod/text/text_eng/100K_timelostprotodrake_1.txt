Oh? This seems to be a note from one of our creators, this seems to come from a different iterator's superstructure, and the pearl seems well cared for as well, where did you find this? 

Nevertheless, I will read it to you. 

"This will be my final broadcast to all surviving kin---unless given response. 

I have declined the offer to depart from our woes, still located on the home I have been born into time and time again. 

One may view my actions as selfish, as wrong to what we have agonizingly built ourselves towards, but if I damn what I will become next, then so be it. 

We have done unspeakable things to this world. 

Massive hive-like monoliths uncontrollable in our climate's disasters, given room to think and writhe like we have cycle after cycle. <LINE>
And under them, sent to simply drown: The creatures we so lovingly held and cared for, and the creatures so inconsequential yet so integral.

Perhaps it was the best solution for all of us, I am not one who argues with philosophers and monks---but the pit in my stomachs will not leave.

What will we leave behind? 

I helped in the upkeep of Accretion Disc Sighting, I will see to it I will remain with it, and to those creatures I had tended to ever since my youth. <LINE>My day to ascend with my creche will come eventually, but not this moment. 

I implore of you to join the rest of our people, but if you choose to stay, and if this reaches you... I will keep these signals in repair.

Do not feel burdened however, I have ample company in my tower.

- Five Great Horns, Brazen Burdened Beast"

...

While my opinions on our creators remain unchanged, I suppose there were few of us who felt company in them.

It is safe to say I never have one such relationship with any of my creators, at least ones I can remember.

I may never understand it.
