Little messenger, this is a final goodbye message written by one of my creators.<LINE>"Nine Stars Above the Shore" was her name.

All the citizens of my city have evacuated, as my systems are failing.

The message is her talking about the importance and fate of us Iterators.

She valued me much, more than anybody else. I'd be surprised if this was not written by her.

All of my creators are long gone now, and soon, I'll be gone too.

Not in the same way as them, though.

...

Messenger, you should not waste your precious cycles worrying about old memories of mine.

Go fulfill your duty.
