This is interesting, little thing. Stay here for a moment.

I have a lot of work to do, so this intrusion will be the only intrusion I will allow. Understand?

Good.

This pearl is the only record I have ever seen of the ancient disaster that roughly translates to "Dance of the Hundred-Thousand." <LINE>There are -- of course -- mutterings and gossip among the old inhabitants of Looks to the Moon's city, but it's highly unlikely much of it is true anymore.

The Dance of the Hundred-Thousand is likely the last unrecorded event, ever. We have archeologists and archivists now who <LINE>bury themselves in the dirt until the Void consumes, but this was something just out of reach for them.

Now... how fascinating, where to begin..."

...!

And now I'm realizing this is a fan-fiction, authored by a certain Iterator I have cut ties with. <LINE>Leave with it now before I or he embarrasses me further.
