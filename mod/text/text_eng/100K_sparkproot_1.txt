This one is an old conversation between Five Pebbles and a friend of his. I'll read it to you.

"1679.560 - PRIVATE<LINE>No Significant Harassment, Five Pebbles

NSH: Pebbles, can you hear me?

FP: Unfortunately. Have you come to try and force me into another ridiculous outfit?

NSH: Nah, I'm just here to recruit you for something that Moon and I have been making together.

FP:  I don't like where this is going...

NSH: Just hear me out.

FP: ...Fine.

NSH: Great.

NSH: So, I know that most of us have been experiencing some.. burnout, so to speak, when it comes to the great problem.

FP: I don't really see how this concerns me.

NSH: Calm down, I'm getting there!

NSH: So, Moon thought it'd be a good idea to come up with something we can do together,<LINE>just to take our minds off of it for a bit, and she let me design a game!

FP: Ah, yes, because as we've seen countless times before, you can be trusted to do things.

NSH: Now you're getting it!

FP: Is sarcasm just a foreign concept to you?

NSH: I was trying to ignore that. Moving on~

NSH: So far, Moon and I have gotten Suns and Sliver to join us.

FP: Why me?

NSH: I know that you probably don't want to be there, but just...

NSH: Give it a try, okay? Moon really wants you there.

FP: Fine. What do I need?

NSH: I'll send the rules once we're getting closer to the start, but now might be a good time to <LINE>start coming up with a character, and you might wanna figure out what program you'll be using for dice.

FP: ...

FP: What have you just dragged me into against my will?

NSH: I'm not gonna spoil it, if that's what you're wondering. Just... try to come up with something that isn't just you.

FP: I'm concerned.

NSH: You should be."
