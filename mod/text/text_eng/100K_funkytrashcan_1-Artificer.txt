Interesting. This pearl pertains to my neighbor Looks to the Moon.

I can tell that it is from before my time, as it discusses some modifications she had done to her puppet. 

There were some objectively beneficial modifications done, but a vast majority of the work done was purely cosmetic.<LINE>However, I know personally that this wasn't done for vanity. 

I do not know how much a little beast like yourself has a concept on gender or identity. But for my citizens, and by extension my own kind, <LINE>personal identity is vitally important. For my creators, they expressed it in their clothes, in their masks, in their very names and titles.

For my kind, our identity is etched into every wall, every microbe working en-tandem in unison.<LINE>However, our form of self-expression is generally considered the form you see in front of you now; the puppet. 

It is but a miniscule portion of our mind, yet it serves two vital purposes;<LINE>as an anchor for our thoughts to flow through, and as a face by which to express ourselves with. 

The latter purpose is what my senior was wishing to improve.<LINE>To put it simply, her internal identity did not mesh with her outer appearance.

It seems like a trivial issue from the outside, especially considering the scale of our puppets, <LINE>but that disparity can destroy you from the inside. Especially if respect for the change is withheld. 

Looks to the Moon was lucky to have such virulent support for her transition, even as the first. <LINE>I was not so fortunate with mine.

... Regardless, I appreciate you bringing this to me. This is a historical text that is novel to my archives, after all. Thank you.
