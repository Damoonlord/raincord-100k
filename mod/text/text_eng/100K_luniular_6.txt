This one seems to have been damaged.

It is written by an iterator whose name has been wiped off the pearl's data.

A section of the written message is still intact. I will read it to you.

"The imperial rain fell again.

On Somewhere, on someone.

Raining down once more.

Again, somewhere was crushed under the rain.

Again, Someone cried under the rain.

All muffled.

Yet we stand here indifferent of the land below.

Promising to help break the cycle of suffering.

Whose sake is it for anymore?

What a selfish prospect."
