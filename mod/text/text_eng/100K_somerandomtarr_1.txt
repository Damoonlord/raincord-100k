This one is formatted strangely. 

It has writing, yes, but its merely a tiny footnote in the corner.<LINE>It looks newer than the rest of the pearl. I will read it to you.

"To my dear sister in the far north. How are you? My scavengers found this while digging around near my can, and I patched it up for you!<LINE>It seemed like something you'd like, and I heard you were stressing quite a lot after... certain situations. Either way, enjoy!"

It seems to be marked by some initials - LV - although I don't know anyone of the sort.<LINE>Regardless, the rest of the pearl is coded to play a short song, and now that I can look into it more, it's visibly aged in some places, and new in others.

What a nice gift! Although, if its here, I wonder if its intended recipient ever got to listen to it.
