It's a pearl meant for use with a personal computer. Do you know what that is?

They were small rectangular devices sometimes decorated in printed patterns or lights. <LINE>Some would include a small spot where one of these pearls could be inserted. <LINE>A mechanism on the other side of the port would read off the data and display it.

The pearl's contents are not in plain text, but due to its use case, it is trivial to decode it.

It contains several games, random programs, hundreds of old text documents, art, and 3D models. <LINE>It's all standard of the time, I don't see any games or tools that were uncommon then.

I couldn't possibly go into more detail - all together it adds up to three terabytes of information, far too large for you to reasonably want to hear.

If I had to say, I do enjoy the art and writing they stored on this! It gives me a peaceful feeling, <LINE>wondering about this person's daily life bringing joy to another's life, even for a brief moment.

Thank you for this, <PLAYERNAME>.
