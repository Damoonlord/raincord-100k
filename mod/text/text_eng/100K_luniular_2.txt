Some of its contents are seeming erased or removed. I will read it to you.

FCM: Hello? Hello..? 

FCM: I hope this reaches you...

FCM: It has been a while

FCM: These cycles have been getting more and more unbearable.

FCM: I've sent a little one to repair a decaying communication array. 

FCM: ... You know, I'm surrounded by fluffy lively things, vibrant scaly things, my creatures, my creations.

FCM: Is this what they call loneliness?

FCM: Please reach me back... 

FCM: I still have so many blueprints to share with you, you know?"

I am not familiar with them, nor do I recall their name. <LINE>Perhaps, they are from far away. 

I wish them well.
