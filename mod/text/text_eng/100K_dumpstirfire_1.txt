Oh! This pearl rather than containing readable text, contains a recording of a song!

It uses a combination of old and new instruments; maybe it was a song dedicated to the growth and evolution to the society our creators had built?

There are lyrics referring to the act of ascension so perhaps it is a reflection before giving a final goodbye.

If only I was still capable of playing recordings in this state so we could hear it, I'm sure it must sound lovely!

Though I'm not sure how much value you would find in these kinds of things, so it isn't too much to feel disappointed about.
