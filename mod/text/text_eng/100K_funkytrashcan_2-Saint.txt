I am surprised that this pearl isn't all that faded.<LINE>In fact, it seems to have been written to relatively recently.

I can get glimpses of what appears to be a map, but it has been overwritten by a message, all in plain text.<LINE>It seems to be adressed to me, but I wouldn't mind reading it out for you, <PLAYERNAME>. 

"I cannot face you. Not like this. Not after so long.

If this message somehow reaches you... I am sorry. I can't help but feel that your condition is somehow my fault. 

Ironically, though, perhaps the circumstances you have found yourself in have preserved you well enough<LINE>for you to end up being among the last of our kind. One of the first, one of the last...

Though, I am not sure how much you would enjoy the idea after so long. 

Regardless, I hope that you are doing well for yourself, after all this time. 

As for me I think I'll finally be finishing what people thought I started. 

Kind regards, Looks ot the Moon. 

-REN"

The name seems to have been overwritten multiple times, and the post-script is illegible.

I also do not recognize the name of this mysterious person. However, I can't help but feel warmed by this message.

To know that there are people that still care, after all this time...

Well, of course I figured that you cared about me too, given that you brought this all the way here~
