This is a data pearl that had the outershell written over itself multiple times;<LINE>specifically with a drawing meant to represent water, I suppose. 

This is farther supported by the fact that, deep below these overwrites, is the sound of freeflowing water.. Oh!

There is also a soft, almost buzzing of sorts, sound beneath this waterflow. 

If I look deep enough, I can see a hazy image of... a small furred creature.<LINE>It seemed to be laying down with its tail curled. 

How... 'adorable'.
