It's an automated maintenance request sent from the local alchemical plant to a storage facility.<LINE>The entire request is broken nonsense.

Makes sense. The data on this pearl is recent, and there's no way the infrastructure could remain coherent for so...

...Oh! hold on - I see patterns in the gibberish. This appears to be... a romantic confession?

You see, our automated facilities are assisted by an intelligent network of microbes.<LINE>I suppose the microbes in the alchemical plant decided they had better things to do, and hijacked the record system.

I wonder how the pearl was supposed to reach the microbes in the shipping facility,<LINE>since the delivery chain has long since decayed. Perhaps the scavengers?

...In that case, I hope they don't take notice of what you've stolen!
