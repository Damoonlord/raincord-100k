Interesting... it's a shutdown request for one of the void fluid extraction pumps in the abandoned drill site near the fallen tramway. 

I'll cut out the technical details, most of which wouldn't interest you...

This pump seems to have erroneously continued its function after the rest were decommissioned...<LINE>the size and material of the pump suggest a pressure buildup that could lead to critical failure.

Oh! There's additional details on here, more recent markings etched onto the pearl's surface...

The request was denied. Put simply, it says that there were no allocatable resources or workforce providable for pump maintenance, <LINE>as work was being focused on the construction of my structure.

That pump has probably long burst by now, I wonder if my creators ever considered the effect this might have on the environment. <LINE>Not like they cared for it much anyway...

I pity any creature who would try to cross themselves out in the runoff, the void fluid would be too impure and diluted to fully erase oneself.

The rest of it is just faded scratches, there seems to have been some frustration..
