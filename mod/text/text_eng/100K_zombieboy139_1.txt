This pearl appears to contain a variety of texts said to be translated from a species far away. <LINE>I wonder how and when we got we texts, but I guess I'm not in the best condition to pursue that problem.

Some of these texts seem to have been spoken by some person; one of them seems to have "I have a dream" said a couple times in the speech, and <LINE>another one sounds like it's trying to incite some sort of protest.

Theres even one in here simply called "State of the Union 2025". <LINE>Reading it, it just sounds like a bunch of problems within the species' civilization.

I would like to read these texts to you <PLAYERNAME>, but I'm afraid you may not understand it, or the rain may drown you out. <LINE>Maybe another time.
