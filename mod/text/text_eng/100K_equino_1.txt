This is quite a rare find! This pearl seems to have traces of data scattered across several patterns of static.<LINE>I am familiar with this sort of layering. 

To honor the passing of inheritance, pearls like these were used ceremonially. One would record memorable events in their life,<LINE>and then, towards the end of their life, would hand down the pearl to their kin. 

After receiving such a pearl, the next generation would write over the contents of the previous owner, leaving some data artifcating.<LINE>This cycle was repeated in this pearl for a large amount of generations, judging by the wear of the pearl.

The idea for these heirloom pearls was that the scattered residual data of the pearl represents the lives of the people<LINE>who it has spent time in the possession of.

I won't reveal the contents of the youngest overwrite of this one, out of respect.<LINE>Although it is unlikely to be written over again, perhaps you should leave it back where you found it,<LINE>or perhaps somewhere nice, <PLAYERNAME>?
