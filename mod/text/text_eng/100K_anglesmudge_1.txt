This is a fascinating find, <PLAYERNAME>!

It's a poem written just after the Void Fluid revolution about the idea of Global Ascension. 

The words have qualia attached but I will read you the plain text.

"Do you know we seek to end your frustrations? Do you know you're not alone? Do you feel the vibration of the place that wants you home?"

Attached is an image of of a lizard, I suppose you would be of similar intelligence?

After all this time these questions have reached their recipient, how interesting!
