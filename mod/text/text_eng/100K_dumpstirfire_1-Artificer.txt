This pearl encodes a recording of a song created by a wandering musician who lived into the dying days of our creators, this was their final song created.

A melody made up of their voice and a variety of instruments meant to act as a prayer for a good fate awaiting them <LINE>beyond the void fluid used in their ascension, due to the fear cultivated by the rumors of failure to fully leave this world behind.

I would play it for you, but I have much better uses of my time to focus on; I doubt a being such as yourself would care <LINE>too deeply for the old songs of a world long gone anyways.
