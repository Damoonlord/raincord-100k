The whole pearl contains... a recipe for how to make soup. Nothing else.<LINE>The recipe isn't even unique to my archives.

It appears someone took this from a popular recipe catalogue.<LINE>If I had to guess, someone used the recipe often enough to justify isolating it from the others.

It's not like I can judge the tastes of my citizens, though. Including yours.
