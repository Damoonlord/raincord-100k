This pearl contain a short story called "The Birds of the Dark Forest".

It tells the tale of one of my creators adventuring into a forest and meeting several birds, each one being drastically different from the previous one.

The tale ends with the protagonist running away from the forest after being attacked by the fourth bird that they encounter, <LINE>after it thought that they were a dangerous intruder that was trespassing in their forest.

Tales like this one were not too uncommon back when my creators where still around. They often gave some moral lesson or <LINE>were used to express some anxiety that its writer thought should be discussed in order to find a solution.

If I had to guess what the birds are meant to represent, I would imagine that they are meant to criticize the use of purposed organisms <LINE>in order to deal with unauthorized life-forms near important infrastructures and the danger that they represent to everyone around them.
